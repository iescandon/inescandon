      "A full stack web/mobile app (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that displays whether nearby biking trails are open. Data is being crowd sourced by fellow bike riders and can only be updated if located within 10 miles of the specific trailhead. Mobile first design.",
    description: "Various mountain bike trail facebook groups are littered with users asking for the trail status. Although some people know the answers, they get frustrated by having to constantly answer the same question over and over. There are apps that have that information available, but they are flooded with too much information that makes finding the trail status quite difficult and hard to understand. Additionally it only provides you with one trails status, so you have to go through the long process again to find out the status of another trail nearby. \n \n This application is a single paged full-stack application designed to find out whether popular biking trails in Texas are open. The user can search by their address, city/state, or zip code to find trails near them. If user allows location access, the map will automatically render in their current location. An interactive map shows the trails listed on the map with markers and also visually states whether or not the trail is open or not based on the color. When a marker is clicked, the name and address of the trail system will be displayed in an info window. User will also be given the opportunity to view the individual trails within the trail system by clicking a button inside the info window. If they click the button, a table will be rendered with all of the trail system data including individual trail data. The table allows for users to update trail status (open/closed) as well as the individual trail conditions. Because of the nature of the targeted users, this app is designed to be very mobile responsive and fully functional on even the smallest screens.",

    blurb:
    "A web app that utilizes the fundamentals of web design (HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery) and web API&apos;s to deliver music recommendations. Users can search by song/artist or artist alone OR can view top songs/artists/albums. Styled with Materialize CSS. Clean, simplistic design.",
    description: "The purpose of this project is to initially test our knowledge of the building blocks of the Web (ie. HTML, CSS, and JS) and how to consume API's in order to create a unique web application specific to a need we see. \n \n Given that each one of us are big consumers of music we thought a recommendation engine based on an artist or song you already enjoy would be a good way to start. The application is primarily built upon the LastFM and Napster API's. When a Artist or Artist/Song combo is input by the user, the applications queries the LastFM API and it's Similar Artist call to give us information. With that in hand, the application then leverages the Napster API to pull all relevant information for that intial call and display it to the user. The user is then allowed to search at their leisure and even enjoy quick song previews with song lyrics as well. \n \n Many positives were gained out of this project. First and foremost was learning how to work as part of a dev team. With different schedules, lifestyles, and availability, accurate planning and communication were of the utmost importance and probably one of the major takeaways from this. Identifying workflow and properly resolving branch related conflict is another thing I believe we were able to come out of this stronger with. Finally, combing through documentation and simply putting in the time to research was displayed and learned throughout this entire process.",
