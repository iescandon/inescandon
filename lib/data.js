When a marker is clicked, the name and address of the trail system will be displayed in an info window. User will also be given the opportunity to view the individual trails within the trail system by clicking a button inside the info window. If they click the button, a table will be rendered with all of the trail system data including individual trail data. The table allows for users to update trail status (open/closed) as well as the individual trail conditions.
