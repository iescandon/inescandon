            {/* As you probaby have already figured out, my name is Inez Escandon and I am a Full Stack Web Developer living out of Houston, TX. */}
            <div>Hey there! I just recently pivoted into Web Development after 10.5 years of being a Bilingual Elementary Teacher. I love working with children but have always had this burning passion with technology. I discovered coding while I was getting my Master's degree in Instructional Technology and knew that this is what I was meant to do.</div>
            {/* <div className="mt-3">I learned how to code at the UT Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp and continue to learn as a Web Developer at Poetic. I really love that coding provides you not only with a creative outlet, but a mental challenge that really pushes analytical higher order thinking. As someone who enjoys learning, I also love that you are required to be a life-long learner to be successful in this profession.</div> */}
            <div className="mt-3">Aside from coding, I love to spend my spare time with my dog Jonah, going to the gym, riding my mountain bike, training brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ), dancing various latin and indian dances, or spending time with friends and family. Feel free to <a href="/contact" className="text-coolBlue md:hover:text-goldenrod">contact me</a> if you have any additional questions!</div>
